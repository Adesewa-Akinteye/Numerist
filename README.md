  We've a total of 3.43bn ribon app installs however, From the chat below;

 872K uninstalled the app, why?. Also, the rate at which users sign up and install app drastically reduced from launch.
This could be as a result of not having enticing features in the app, users not seeing the need to keep using the app, when a user finds it's not worth the memory its holding, Tedious Sign-Up Process,Too Many Permissions, Irrelevant Notifications, battery draining and many more.

The average time spent by users is 5 hours 30 minutes, this brings us to the fact that there are enticing features on the app but only enticing enought to some.

Generally, the ideal app crash rate is less than 1% per user, a minimum of 1.09% of daily active users experience a user-perceived crash, across all device models. The average crash rate for mobile applications should have a very low range of 1â€“2%  with 98% crash free users. The crash rate per active user 6% (0.06) is however more than the minimal from the analysis.

Only 38.9% of post made are seen which could be as a result of too many post at a time by user, a shadowbanned account, a built algorithm that prevents spamming or posts not fit to algorithm.

77% of ribbon total sign up uses the app actively, 23% probably find it hard to see an enticing feature on the app or see no reason to stay active and spend more time using the app.

Users tend to post more on thursdays, more likes and retweets on saturdays. After work and on the weekend are great times to post because people are relaxing and browsing social networks at their own pace. People have more leisure time and are more willing to give time to mobile more during weekends.


##  Conclusion
The overall analysis shows that Ribbon app has the potential of being more successful, The total engagement is fair enough compared to the installs and sign-ups, The decrease in sign up since launch contributed to the engagement, Having more increase and features, building up the sign-up process and installs will generally increase active users resulting to increment in engagement overall.

## Risk of Delay
There are chances of more users not installing nor signing up with the app as the rate gradually reduces over the month, the earlier to take action, the better.

## How can we leverage the success of the app launch to further enhance our products and services?
Recommendations to further enhance the app are listed below.
- - -

- ## Recommendations
1. **Users Feedbacks:** We can generate a short questionaire or feedback dropdown (not rate as this will only give quantitative insight and not qualitative) that pops while a user is about to uninstall and installs the app, this will give possible reasons to **why** users uninstall and more insights on what we can improve on.
2. **Sign_up Process and Privacy concern:** A lengthy sign-up process is a big turnoff for most users. For the app to surpass the installation stage and later engage the user the app should have a quick and easy sign up process. To simplify things further apps can also allow a log in using Instantsnaps. Privacy is a major concern when installing new apps. Apps that ask for way to many permissions may get discarded instantly, Should be limited if need be.
3. **Irrelevant Notifications and Battery Draining:** Push notifications popping up too frequently, there should be a limit to this and users approval on getting notified, The battery usage of app on device should be
reduced to minimal.
4. **Free Memory and Data Usage**: Ribbon memory  and Data usage should be as low as possible to avoid users from finding it not worth the memory it's holding and data consumption.
5. **Crash Rate:** The tech team should work on possible solutions to fix and reduce the rate of crashes and vitals can be used to track app crash rate.
6. **Time on app:** We can get to review the features on the app people spend more time on and make it more enticing to increase the hours spent overall also, giving more of individual interest on feed.
7. **Engagement, Referral and Rewards:**
- We can generate points or ranking system to reward users based on their post and engagement.
- We can also give point for daily activeness on the site which can be redeemed at a specified point.
- The rate for post seen can be increased by improving the algorithim built for the app
- An in-app ads can be created on instantsnaps for users to take a look at the just launched ribbon app, use and get points which can be redeemable at a point, with the high rate of audience on instantsnap, the surge for install and sign up will be high if this is done. However more enticing features should be worked on before proceeding with this so users see a reason to stay active.
- An algorithm can be built to give users a pop message on best time to post according to their region or time zone, whenever they want to post for more engagement.
